Lecture 2 Q's

* Explain rate and population encoding with examples of each:
  - Population encoding is when different neurons encode different mental states/experiences
  - this means that there is one neuronal circuit that fires when we fall in love, and another 
    one when we smell a cake
  - rate encoding is when the experiences are encoded as a function of the rate of excitation of the 
    neuronal circuits (different firing rates => different experiences)
  - 

* Factors which affect the firing rate in neurons?

* How are inputs transformed in the specific neural networks (examples) + why is this useful?
